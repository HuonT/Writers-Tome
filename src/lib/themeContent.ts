    content: `Themes help give your characters individuality and nuanced struggles to contend with that readers can relate to in a more real way than to the actual objective of the plot of the book (especially if it is fantasy), and ultimately give more meaning to your story. Your reader might not be able to relate so well to having to "slay the dragon" in the epic final battle, but they can relate to the personal inner struggles of self discovery, moral dilemma, or philosophical searching, along the way.

Note: Themes are not your character's main motivation that directly relates to the plot, but can be tied closely to it, even interplaying with the main (more objective) motivation. A strong character should have a main motivation that is plot related and clearly defined early in the book as previously discussed. Themes on the other hand, can be used to give your character more depth of personality that evokes struggle and emotion.`

Themes are mostly presented with no immediate right or wrong answer, but are contended with via the characters throughout the narrative of the book, often being a large part of the conflict and resolution between characters as the characters grow and develop new understandings.`,

• Left side: belonging, comfort, security
• Right side: personal growth, transformation, courage
• Resolution: acceptance of necessary self-sacrifices

This push-pull dynamic creates internal conflict that drives character development. Other topics could be based around betrayal, faith, redemption, forgiveness, destiny and fate, breaking out of family or societal expectations etc.`

    content: `Dialogue and interactions are the best way to show your characters' personalities, as well as the most gripping way to make decisions that will drive the narrative and the plot.

Integrating themes into character dialogue can make your conversations more meaningful and impactful. When characters discuss or debate thematic elements naturally through their interactions, it adds depth and tension to both the characters and the themes themselves. This approach helps avoid heavy-handed exposition while making the themes feel organic to the story. Here are two examples of how themes can add tension and create gripping interactions: a. A character who is wrestling with a chosen theme may say things to other characters that they internally clearly don't believe or agree with, allowing the reader to feel the character's inner tension. Or b. A character might have a discussion with another character with opposing views, either heatedly, coldly, subtly, or happily, also creating tension.

To tie in themes that make your story more meaningful, make them a point of character tension. This will really help you to build strong characters that people will root for… or against if they are villains.`,

        content: `Let's look at an example from LOTR and the character of Samwise.

"This is it; if I take one more step it'll be the furthest I've ever been from home." - Sam

Sam's themes would have:
• Left side: staying in comfort zone, contentment with simple life, and fear
• Right side: loyalty, friendship, and humility
• Resolution: development of courage and sense of duty

These themes continue to push and pull through Sam's character arc, continually resulting in Sam's bravery increasing.

"I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!"

Sam's role as a loyal companion character sees a full transformation arc and results in great courage and loyalty in his character. In the end, after finishing a sidekick hero's journey arc of his own, his newfound confidence of character and courage wins him the girl he loves, while still retaining the initial personality traits that make him Sam.

As a fun exercise, try bringing all your characters together on a page using only dialogue. This will help you familiarize yourself with your characters, and with using dialogue to create tension, by expressing their individual voices and themes.`

        content: `Portray themes through character dialogue and interactions. Dialogue and interactions are the best way to show your characters' personalities, as well as the most gripping way to make decisions that will drive the narrative and the plot.

The best way to tie themes in that make your story more meaningful is to make them a point of character tension. This will really help you to build strong characters that people will root for… or against if they are villains.

In summary, themes can be used to make your characters unique by giving them different emotions and motives, thus bringing additional tension and relationships between the characters in your cast. This in turn creates anticipation in your readers' minds as they find depth and relatable qualities in your characters. They will then want to know how the characters deal with the themes and struggles they face, anxious as to whether it will bring characters closer together or tear them apart.`
